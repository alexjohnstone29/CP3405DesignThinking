- retrospective/reflection meeting

- discussion around what the next project iteration would look like
- we would start using engines like unity to develop a working prototpye focusing on the ar lesson itself

- another future iteration would be to develop the workspace portal with a deployable GUI (can be broken up into multiple sprints)
- discussion around deliverable items for the submittable document, what items are needed to be included and assigning parts of the document.
